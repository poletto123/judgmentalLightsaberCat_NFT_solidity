### **DETAILS**

- NFT contract built with Solidity and Hardhat

- Unit tests of contract made with Chai, Mocha and Waffle

- Deployed the contract on the Goerli test network on the Ethereum blockchain. The transaction can be viewed on Etherscan, which is a public visualizer for any transaction that happens on the blockchain - https://goerli.etherscan.io/address/0xD1ADeC606Ea9BE252C38357a9A04767163E41553

- Front-end website made with ReactJS (Hooks) and Chakra UI, which allows for an user to mint up to 3 NFT's of 3 different kinds directly to their Metamask wallet

- NFT's are accesible by the biggest NFT marketplace, which is OpenSea (test version), allowing you to sell your NFT - https://testnets.opensea.io/collection/lightsabercat-4

- Hosted the metadata via a decentralized storage protocol called IPFS, via the Pinata gateway. File example - https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmPywqhLiveEuSpnqjvH5XibgoGpf6kXTGJucAYt1EHcZC/1.json
